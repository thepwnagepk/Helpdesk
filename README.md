# Helpdesk
Java Helpdesk CLI 

Made in BlueJ (which i would never recommend beyond learning, its nightmarishly unoptimised), and as of writing is a mess of files because of it.

To Run:  

Install BlueJ.  

Open the package.bluej file.  

In the main screen, Right click the 'Tester' object box and create a new Tester() (name it anything you want)  

It will ask you for a username and password, use the username 'pk' and password of '123' for admin control and account CRUD.  

From here you can play around and figure out how to access the receptionists, perhaps by using option 4 to view all accounts to reveal that the Receptionist username and password is 'janedoe' and '12345', but that may prove too difficult a challenge.  

Then test to your hearts content. 



Documentation can be read in the 'doc' folder.
