# Helpdesk
Java Helpdesk CLI 

Made in BlueJ (which i would never recommend beyond learning, its nightmarishly unoptimised), and as of writing is a mess of files because of it.

To Run:  

Install BlueJ.  

Open the package.bluej file.  

In the main screen, Right click the 'Tester' object box and create a new Tester() (name it anything you want)  

It will ask you for a username and password, and as far as i know the only account credentials on there are the username 'pk' and password of '123' (very secure, i know).  

Then test to your hearts content . 

Documentation can be read in the 'doc' folder.
